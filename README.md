# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #4: Full-stack React Application

### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date, and it'll hopefully be the shining beacon of bragging rights for your portfolio as you make your way out into the world.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.** You are **required** to use React for this project.

Make sure you review your project idea with an instructor so you can make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that'll be challenging**. Sometimes people do judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design so we want this project to also be visually impressive.

### Technical Requirements

* **Build a full-stack application** by building your own server-side api that is consumed by your own client-side front-end. 
* **The server-side API must be restful**.
* **The client-side front-end** must be built using React, and it must retrieve data from your server-side API. 
* **Be a relatively comprehensive**, which means at least two related data models with complete CRUD functionality for at least a one of those models.
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** prioritized to help guide you.
* **Be deployed online** so that it's publicly accessible

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working, full-stack application** that uses React on the front-end, that's hosted somewhere on the internet (Heroku).

* Your application **MUST** have authentication. The use of JSON Web Tokens for authentication/authorization **is HIGHLY recommended**.

* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.

* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your GitHub repo

* A `readme.md` file at the root of the project's git repo with:

    - A screenshot of the finished application ([Taking screenshots on a Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361))
    - An introduction to the application
      - What is it?
      - What problem(s) does it aim to solve?
    - Explanations of the technologies used.
    - **Document your app's RESTful JSON API**. [Here's an example](https://i.imgur.com/cBaKtoc.png)
    - Installation/startup instructions. How can a potential employer run your code *locally* on their own machine?
    - A [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) of the initial idea. You could take a screenshot of a wireframe using [Gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/), [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), or even just draw it on a napkin and snap a photo!
    - An **ERD** (entity relationship diagram) for the data models in your app. The quickest way to get a nice looking ERD is to build one with [Gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/), take a screenshot of it, and include the screenshot in your readme. But again, a napkin sketch works just as well!
    - A **Backlog**: Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome.
    - Take advantage of Markdown syntax in your `readme.md` using this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)!
    - A link to your **publicly accessible** trello board, described below:

* A **Trello board** with **User Stories**, each moving from left to right in the following lists in your board:

    - *Backlog* (stretch goals)
    - *To-Do* (what you think you can get done during the week)
    - *Doing* (what feature(s) you are working on NOW)
    - *Done* (what features have been tested and merged into the main codebase)

    The lists in your trello board don't have to be named exactly like the ones listed above, but those are a good reference point to start with.

    Prioritize your user stories within the *Backlog* with your "wish list" stories at the bottom.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your API RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.**
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back to a previous version, as long as you utilize git branches.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Keep your code well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Q&A App
Think of how helpful sites like Quora & StackOverflow are. Maybe there's some other niche, or some surprising twist you can add to the question-and-answer game.

##### Car Repair Log
Keep up with your vehicle as you commute every day to your final weeks of WDI save things like mileage, last inspect, oil changes, and maybe even receipts & important document you need to have backed up.

##### Email-like Messages
Imagine a realtime messaging client, but with private messages, an inbox, unread messages, and who knows what else. This is your chance to re-invent email as we know it.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

- __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

- __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

- __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Is your code commented well enough for another developer to reason about your code easily?

- __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

- __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

  | Score | Expectations                                         |
  | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
  | **1** | _Does not meet expectations._                        |
  | **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_                     |
  | **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |
